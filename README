This is my first GUI programming experience.

I basically wanted a one click method for importing custom Gimp brushes I download, and came up with this.
It is buit in python v2.7.2 and PyQt4

only tested on Linux Mint 13
will only work with Gimp 2.6

Download your brush files to your desktop, type in your linux system username and press the install gimp brush
button. Voila, you instantly have your brushes in gimp.
